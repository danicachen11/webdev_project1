  	<h1>Welcome to My Hobbies Page</h1>
    <p>Sharing my love for art, journaling, and stationery!</p>
  	<section id="mediums">
  	  <h2>Art</h2>
  	  <p>I enjoy experimenting with various art forms such as graphite, watercolor, and acrylic. Each medium has its own charm:</p>
  	  <ul>
  	    <li><strong>Graphite:</strong> I love how versatile it is and all you need is one singular good pencil. I like seeing very clear and dark contrast.</li>
  	    <li><strong>Watercolor:</strong> I find watercolors hard to work with becasue of how hard it can be to control and also the necessity to find good paper. However, I still do enjoy the vibrant and fluid nature.</li>
  	    <li><strong>Acrylic:</strong> Acrylic paints are fantastic for bold, colorful artworks. They dry fast and allow me to layer colors quickly!</li>
  	   </ul>

            <h2>Stationery</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about stationery! It's always fun to try over enginnered tools and finding the right tools make note-taking more efficient and fun:</p>
            <ul class="hobby-list">
                <li><strong>Campus Notebooks:</strong> These are my go-to for my school nottaking. They're affordable, durable, and the paper is smooth for easy writing. I use the A6 size because then it's easier to fill a single page which then moltivates me to continue taking more notes.</li>
                <li><strong>Jetstream Pens:</strong> These pens are great for everyday writing. From the afforable price, they write smoothly and are good quality. They're also refillable! </li>
